                  <h3>About Crosby</h3>
                  <h5>#Canada #Penguins #87</h5>
                  <p>
                    Sidney Patrick Crosby ONS was born in 1987, and he is a Canadian professional ice hockey player who serves 
                    as captain of the Pittsburgh Penguins of the National Hockey League. 
                    Nicknamed "Sid the Kid" and dubbed "The Next One", Crosby was selected first 
                    overall by the Penguins in the 2005 NHL Entry Draft, and is widely regarded 
                    as one of the greatest hockey players of all time. <br /><br />

                    Crosby's jersey number (87) and 2007 contract signing ($8.7 million per year) reflect his 
                    birthdate (8/7/87). Crosby grew up in nearby Cole Harbour, and has a younger sister, 
                    Taylor. His father was a goaltender who played for the Verdun Junior Canadiens 
                    in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL).
                    Crosby began playing hockey by himself in his basement at the age of two years, 
                    shooting pucks in a net that had the family dryer behind it, leading to a 
                    longstanding misconception that he was actually practising with the dryer; 
                    he learned to skate at three. <br /> <br /> 
                    Crosby continues to be active in the community in Cole Harbour, Nova Scotia. 
                    He created the Sidney Crosby Foundation in 2009, an organization committed to 
                    providing support to charities benefiting children.
                     In 2015, he launched an inaugural Hockey School in Cole Harbour.
                      His "Little Penguins Program" has provided free equipment and lessons 
                      to more than ten thousand local youngsters in Pittsburgh.
